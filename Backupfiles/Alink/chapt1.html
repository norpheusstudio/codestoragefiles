        I was walking alone in the alley, I saw a black figure at the end before he left but there was something he dropped off, "A mysterious old box.." I said confusingly, "He probably didn't notice that he dropped this box?" I added. I stand up and go where he went through earlier. I felt something while I was walking and suddenly, I fainted.<br>
        <br>
        The next day, Morning<br>
        <br>
        I woke up with the mysterious old box beside me, I kept it hidden in my drawer so no one would see it before I left the house, While I was walking on my way to my office, I felt strange, someone was looking at me behind. I look behind but there's nothing, I might be hallucinating because of what happened yesterday.<br>
        <br>
        I meet the director in the hallway and she was seems waiting for me, "I've been waiting for you, Mr. Sai" Director said, "I'm sorry, Director Miku" I said. while we were about to go on the elevator, there was a hoodie guy and he glance at me before the elevator door close, "Such a gloomy eyes" I said.<br>
        <br>
        "Director Miku, Our profit was starting to decrease as we lack of the content we had, Take a look on our revenue, Director, you see that it start last week ago. We need to take an action now", I reported the statistic we have for the past two weeks and it's not quite well to know. "Mr. Sai, Tell to the other Head developer that we will be having a meeting tomorrow as we discuss this problem" Director Miku said, "Sure, Director" I replied.<br>
        <br>
        Studio<br>
        —<br>
        <br>
        "Good day!" I greet them, "Ohh, Mr. Sai, good to see you, What's up?" Reku said. I give the letter about the meeting for tomorrow, "We were having a discussion about the situation in our company we've been through right now" I said, "Sure, we will go tomorrow, Mr. Sai" Reku said and I left the studio.<br>
        <br>
        I was minding on how would be the solution of our decreasing amount of users, but suddenly I got bumped into something, "I'm sorry" I said and I saw him again the hoodie guy with a gloomy eyes. "Hey!" I shouted on him, He ignores it and keep walking through. I stand up but It suddenly hurts, "Blood..?" I confusingly asked "Wait, Did the guy do this on me?" I added.<br>
        <br>
        As I walking towards on his path, I got fainted. I wake up in the hospital while beside me is Director Miku, "Are you feeling okay, Sai?" Miku asked, "Yea, I'm feeling better now, what happened?" I asked Miku, "You've got stabbed and where looking at him now" She replied. I wonder who he was the guy who stabbed me.<br>
        <br>
        Director Miku gave me something and it was a letter from someone, "Meet me ya' 4th street, boi, crooked it up on Sunday, be at 10 or else.. you'll die" He said. "4th street? But why is it me?" I asked Miku, "We still don't know but we will gonna tail on you" She said, "No, It's fine, I'll go there alone" I replied, "But-" I stopped her right before she speaks "Director Miku, I will be fine, Oky?" I assure her, "Okay" She answered.<br>
        <br>
        12th of Saturday, 10pm<br>
        –<br>
        <bt>
        I'm walking alone going where the guy told me, "Who is he? I got involved on something? Am I wanted?" Those questions keep speaking in my mind. "Pst!" Someone was calling me, "Boi, right here" I looked back in the alley where the same way I went through before the mysterious old box been. "What do you want?" I asked him "Listen boi, the mysterious old box are too powerful, use it when the comes" He answered, "What's hidden inside?" I asked him, "You'll figure it out soon" He answered and someone hit my head.<br>
        <br>
        13th of Sunday, 6:38am<br>
        –<br>
        <br>
        "You finally wake up, Sai" Miku said<br>
